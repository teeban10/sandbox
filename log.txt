In retaliation, young James kills Thomas with bone claws that emerge from the back of his hands, as his mutation manifests.[29] He flees with his childhood companion, Rose, and grows into manhood on a mining colony in the Yukon, adopting the name \"Logan\".[30] When Logan accidentally kills Rose with his claws, he flees the colony and lives in the wilderness among wolves,[31] until he is captured and placed in a circus.[32] Saul Creed, brother of Victor Creed, frees Logan, but after he betrays Logan and Clara Creed to Nathaniel Essex, Logan drowns Creed in Essex's potion.[33] Logan returns to civilization, residing with the Blackfoot people. Following the death of his Blackfoot lover, Silver Fox, at the hands of Victor Creed, now known as Sabretooth,[34] he is ushered into the Canadian military during World War I.

As depicted in Amazing Fantasy #15 (Aug. 1962), he is bitten by a radioactive spider (erroneously classified as an insect in the panel) at a science exhibit and \"acquires the agility and proportionate strength of an arachnid\".[44] Along with super strength, Parker gains the ability to adhere to walls and ceilings. Through his native knack for science, he develops a gadget that lets him fire adhesive webbing of his own design through small, wrist-mounted barrels. Initially seeking to capitalize on his new abilities, Parker dons a costume and, as \"Spider-Man\", becomes a novelty television star. However, \"He blithely ignores the chance to stop a fleeing thief, [and] his indifference ironically catches up with him when the same criminal later robs and kills his Uncle Ben.\" Spider-
